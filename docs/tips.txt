*Typical Training Split*
- The book recommends short, frequent sessions, often 3–4 days per week.

Example Split (Classic)
- Day A
      - Pushups
      - Squats
- Day B
     - Pullups
     - Leg Raises
- Day C
     - Bridges
     - Handstand Push-ups 

Then repeat after rest days as needed.

*Sets, Reps, and Progression*

- Usually 2–3 work sets per exercise
- Rep ranges depend on the progression level
- You don’t train to failure
- When you hit the top rep goal with perfect form → advance to the next step

Example:

- Step 4 Pushups: goal = 2×20 reps
- Once achieved → move to Step 5
- Once you master a Lvl, you move onto next one
- 
*Key Rules Paul Wade Emphasizes*
- Perfect form beats high reps
- Slow progression = stronger joints & tendons
- Minimal equipment
- Consistency over intensity
- Rest days are encouraged—recovery matters

What Makes It Different
- No maxing out
- No bodybuilding splits
- No “burn” chasing
- It’s about long-term strength, durability, and control
